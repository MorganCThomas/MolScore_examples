# Generative models with MolScore integrated

This repository provides examples of generative models that natively integrate [MolScore](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore) (e.g., [SMILES-RNN](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/SMILES-RNN)) or, adaptations to models to integrate MolScore.

## Installation

Some models here are installed as git submodules to allow dynamic updates as they are developed. To clone everything use:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore_examples.git

## Usage

For further use cases, refer to each models subdirectory.
